! ! Note:
1. In order to avoid the interference of sunlight on the infrared sensor, this experiment needs to be carried out indoors.
2. In the infrared remote control experiment, there is a row of pins above the 51 core board on the expansion board, and the right two pin headers should be equipped with a jumper cap, as shown in the figure below.
3.We need to unplug the small fan and grayscale modules.
4. During remote control, the infrared remote control needs to face the infrared receiver on the expansion board.
